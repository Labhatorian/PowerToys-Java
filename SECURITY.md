## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a vulnerability in the program follow these steps:
1. Go to https://github.com/Labhatorian/PowerToys/issues
2. Create a new issue
3. Give it the tag `Security`
4. Use the template for security related issues

A developer will check it out as soon as possible and start the issue process.
If it gets declined, you can expect a response why.
